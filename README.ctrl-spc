 I can't set a mark to select text in emacs. Ctrl+space insert a space character instead of setting the mark.


Ok I found what was the problem for me. IBus daemon had been configured to use the same shortcut. It can be changed by:

ibus-setup

and then restarting the daemon using something like:

killall ibus-daemon
ibus-daemon -d
